# HR Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

Organizations often manage large volumes of employee data across departments, roles, age groups, and locations. Without proper analytics, HR teams struggle to track workforce trends, monitor attrition, and plan resources effectively.

This project uses Power BI to build an interactive HR analytics dashboard that provides clear insights into headcount, attrition, and workforce distribution, enabling data-driven HR decision-making.

## Problem Statement

- HR teams lack a centralized and visual system to analyze employee data efficiently. As a result:

- Workforce distribution is difficult to understand

- Attrition trends are not easily identifiable

- Diversity and departmental insights remain unclear

- Strategic workforce planning becomes reactive

- This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw HR data into actionable insights.

## Dataset Used

- Attrition Count – Number of employees who left the organization

- Attrition Rate – Percentage of employees leaving over a period

- Year-on-Year Headcount Trend – Workforce growth or decline over time

- Year-on-Year Attrition Trend – Changes in attrition levels year over year
